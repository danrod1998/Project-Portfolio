# Project-Portfolio

## For further context on the items viewed in this repository:
### The R project is an analysis of Google Play Store data
### The Powerpoint is the output file of a Tableau project involving the analysis of AirBnB data that I worked on
### The Python files are samples of past projects from when I worked at A&D Mortgage (stripped of any working sensitive information/connections for viewing purposes).
